    <!-- Section that tells more about myself -->
    <h2>A Little Bit More About Myself</h2>
    <p>I'm Jacques Naude working as an SEO at an agency in Cape Town, where our main focus is Pay Per Click advertising and Search
        Engine Optimisation. I've been working as an SEO for a little over one year, and I got to a point where I wanted a challenge that could assist me in my career. I've embarked on studying a Full Stack Web Development program in order to improve my skills as a web developer, and to enhance my skills as an SEO.</p>
    <p>In 2017, I completed my Bachelor of Commerce in Marketing Management, and subsequently moved to Cape Town and joined the BMW Group as a product specialist, formally known as a BMW Genius. I learned a lot while working for BMW, but my main focus was working with clients, and ensuring that they were enthused by both BMW cars and the BMW brand.</p>
    <p>While working at BMW, I grew increasingly interested in digital marketing and Search Engine Optimisation. I ultimately decided to complete a course in SEO, and six months later, after completing my course, I started working at an SEO agency, and I've been working there since 2018.</p>
    <p>I am extremely passionate about music, and in my free time, I always make time to play the piano. I also have a passion for cars, hence working for BMW for over a year. I also enjoy playing XBOX in my free time, mostly racing simulation games. I also love nature, and like to spend time outside. Other than that, I also go the the gym in my free time.</p>
   <!-- Skills and competencies -->
    <h3>My Skills & Competencies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer interaction and communication.</li>
        <p>Working for BMW for over one year, as well as other companies, enabled me to effectively work and communicate to customers, and to ensure that customer needs were consistently met.</p>
        <li>Working in a team as well as remotely.</li>
        <p>My role at BMW placed me in a position where I had to work effectively and efficiently in a team, as well as working well on my own.</p>
        <li>Google Analytics.</li>
        <p>As soon as I started working for iMod Digital, I started studying through the Google Academy to become proficient in Google Analytics on a beginner as well as an advanced level. This enabled me to understand the purpose and functionality on Google Analytics, and taking the data displayed to me and conveying that into client reports.</p>
        <li>Google Tag Manager.</li>
        <p>Google Tag Manager is a tool where tags and triggers are created and managed, and added to Google Analytics Goals in order to establish and track the importance of content on a website, as well as monitoring client interactions and conversions. I completed a Google Tag Manager course that enabled me to understand the fundamentals of Google Tag Manager, and to set up goals using GTM.</p>
        <li>Google Adwords.</li>
        <p>Google Adwords is one of the most important tools we use. We use Adwords to set up ads for clients as to increase traffic and especially conversions for clients. I have intermediate experience working on Google Adwords.</p>
        <li>Search Engine Optimisation.</li>
        <p>Working at iMod Digital, which predominantly places focus on Search Engine Optimisation, has given me great insight as to what it takes to optimise a website, as well as the inner workings behind Search Engine Optimisation - from mobile speed, to meta data and content on the website.</p>
        <li>Analysing and interpreting data from marketing tools such as Google Analytics, Semrush and Ahrefs.</li>
        <p>One of the key services offered by iMod Digital involves the writing of monthly reports so that clients are aware of and understand traffic performance. Here, it is important to understand historical data in order to understand how SEO is paying off. It is also important to understand seasonal trends, and to be aware of what every client's competition is doing.</p>
        <li>Social media content curation and management.</li>
        <p>One of my roles at iMod Digital is the management and curation of content on our social media pages that keeps our followers engaged. It is important to understand what content users will find valuable and which content they would interact with most.</p>
        <li>Writing monthly SEO & PPC reports.</li>
        <p>As mentioned previously, one of our key offerings at iMod Digital is writing monthly reports. It is important to translate data in such a way so that clients understand what is being said, and in order for them to understand why traffic declines at certain stages through the year, where applicable.</p>
        <li>Working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
        <p>I've recently embarked on a journey to further my digital knowledge, and came to a decision to study HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

    <h3>My Experience</h3>
    <img src="Images/bmw-x7-in-motion.jpg" id="bmwX7" alt="BMW X7 driving with scenery">
    <p>Since completing my BCOM Degree, I went on to work for BMW as a Product Specialist - formally known as a BMW Genius. I was responsible for enthusing customers about the BMW brand. One of my main roles was to assist the sales team through the sales process from start to finish. I was the main person responsible for conducting test drives and explaining vehicles and technology to clients. Another responsibility involved the assurance that clients knew their vehicles to an advanced extent before leaving the dealership floor, and continuing the process of informing existing clients with vehicle knowledge beyond the sale of their vehicles.</p>
    <p>After working for BMW for a little bit over one year, including being internationally certified as a BMW Genius, my digital marketing and online journey begin when I started working as an SEO at iMod Digital. Since working at iMod Digital, I have completed various courses including a Digital Marketing course, a course in Google Analytics and a Google Tag Manager course. Currently, I am still working at iMod Digital, while completing my coding course.</p>
  <!-- Projects that I have worked on -->
    <h3>Projects that I have worked on</h3>
    <p>Since starting my Full Stack Web Developer Program through <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/">Hyperion Development</a>, I have worked on a number of projects that were created to test my skills and competencies. These tasks were set up to test how well I could implement the code that I have learned. Below is a list of projects that I have worked on.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Capstone Projects</li>
        <p>In the first section of the Capstone project, it was required that I create an online store that would showcase my HTML, CSS skills. When the first part of this project was completed, the website had all the elements and styling needed in order to look like a properly functioning website without, yet no JavaScript had been implemented. In the second part, it was required that I implement the JavaScript so that the website could be interactive and work as an ecommerce website. I subsequently went on to complete several other capstone projects to showcase my proficiency in JavaScript, as well as MERN principles</p>
        <li>Smaller HTML projects</li>
        <p>In previous assignments following up to Capstone, it was required that I showcase my skills and competencies in the form of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express an much more. By completion of the tasks involving the above mentioned, I showcased my HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB & NodeJS proficiency.</p>
